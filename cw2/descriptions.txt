The data is stored in the data.json file using the json module.
 The data is saved as a dictionary, with each key being a website name, and its
 value being another dictionary containing the email and password associated with 
that website. The saved data is read and updated using the open() and 
json.load() functions, and then written to the file again using json.dump().
